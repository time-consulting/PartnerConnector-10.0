## Backend Architecture
The backend is a RESTful API developed with Express.js and TypeScript, designed for scalability and maintainability.

- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect.
- **Session Management**: Express sessions stored in PostgreSQL using connect-pg-simple.
- **File Handling**: Multer for file uploads.

## Database Design
A PostgreSQL database underpins the application, featuring core entities such as:
- **Users**: User profiles, including onboarding status, GDPR/marketing consent, and authentication security fields (emailVerified, verificationToken, passwordResetToken, passwordResetExpires, loginAttempts, lockoutUntil, lastLogin).
- **Referrals**: Tracks submitted referrals, their status, and associated information.
- **Quotes**: Manages quotes sent from Dojo, including customer journey status.
- **Business Types**: Categorization of businesses for commission calculations.
- **Bill Uploads**: Stores client payment processing bills.
- **Commission Payments**: Records commission payouts to users.
- **Sessions**: Stores user session data.
- **Partner Hierarchy**: Tracks multi-level marketing (MLM) relationships and commission structures.

## Authentication & Authorization
- **Provider**: Custom email/password authentication with GoHighLevel email integration.
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions using connect-pg-simple.
- **Route Protection**: Middleware-based checks for secure access.
- **User Management**: Automatic user creation and updates upon successful authentication, with a mandatory 3-step onboarding flow for new users.
- **Security Features**:
  - Email verification required for all new accounts
  - Password strength requirements (min 8 chars, at least 1 letter + 1 number)
  - Rate limiting: 5 failed login attempts trigger 15-minute account lockout
  - Secure password reset with token expiration (1 hour)
  - Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
  - Verification email resend capability

## File Upload System
- **Storage**: In-memory with Multer (10MB limit).
- **Security**: File type and size validation.
- **Association**: Files are linked to specific referrals.

## UI/UX Decisions
- **Design Language**: Inspired by Dojo.tech, featuring rounded cards, clear action buttons, and professional typography.
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Responsive design across all components, including a mobile-optimized referral form and quick add lead capture.
- **Dashboard Redesign**: Three distinct sections: Hero Overview, Action Hub, and Engagement Feed.
- **Navigation**: Desktop side navigation (expandable) and mobile hamburger menu.
- **Quotes Page**: Card-based grid layout with a full-screen detail modal and distinct customer journey stages.
- **Referral Form Redesign**: Streamlined 3-stage mobile-first flow without an earnings preview sidebar.
- **Admin Portal**: Streamlined two-tab structure: (1) Quote Requests showing new submissions with comprehensive details (business info, current processor, products, funding), (2) Deal Management Pipeline with 7 progression stages. Removed duplicate quote request subtab for clarity.
- **Training System**: Gamified learning hub with progression (Bronze to Platinum Partner), achievement badges, and learning streaks.
- **Referral Status**: Default status changed from 'pending' to 'submitted' to ensure new referrals appear immediately in Quote Requests tab.

## Features and Functionality
- **Quotes Management**: View, approve, question, request rate changes, and send quotes to clients.
- **Onboarding System**: Mandatory multi-step onboarding for new users.
- **Team Tracking & MLM**: Referral code generation, hierarchical team linking (L1=60%, L2=20%, L3=10% commissions), and real-time team analytics.

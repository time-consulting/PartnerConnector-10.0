# 💵 Business Funding Training - Complete Guide

## Introduction to Business Funding Solutions

Business funding represents significant commission opportunities through our LTV-based structure. Every business needs cash flow solutions, making this a valuable service area for building long-term client relationships.

## Types of Funding We Offer

### 1. Merchant Cash Advance (MCA)
**Best for**: Businesses with consistent card sales
**Funding Range**: Available for various business needs
**Repayment**: Flexible daily percentage based on card sales
**Approval Time**: 24-48 hours
**Commission**: Calculated using LTV methodology based on funding amount and business profile

#### How It Works:
1. Business receives lump sum upfront
2. Repays through daily card sales deductions
3. Higher sales days = higher repayments
4. Lower sales days = lower repayments
5. Flexible and cash-flow friendly

### 2. Unsecured Business Loans
**Best for**: Established businesses with good credit
**Funding Range**: Suitable for various business requirements
**Term**: Flexible terms available
**Structure**: Competitive rates based on business assessment
**Commission**: LTV-based calculation considering loan value and business factors

### 3. Asset-Based Lending
**Best for**: Businesses with valuable equipment/property
**Funding Range**: Substantial funding available for established businesses
**Security**: Secured against business assets
**Commission**: Higher LTV calculations due to secured nature and larger amounts

## Perfect Funding Candidates

### High-Success Businesses:
1. **Restaurants & Hospitality**
   - Seasonal cash flow needs
   - Equipment upgrades
   - Expansion opportunities

2. **Retail Businesses**
   - Stock purchases
   - Seasonal inventory
   - Store renovations

3. **Healthcare Practices**
   - Equipment financing
   - Practice expansion
   - Staff hiring

4. **Professional Services**
   - Office setup
   - Technology upgrades
   - Marketing campaigns

### Red Flags to Avoid:
❌ New businesses (< 6 months trading)
❌ Declining revenue trends
❌ Multiple existing funding arrangements
❌ Poor credit history (for unsecured loans)
❌ Cash-only businesses

## Qualification Process

### Initial Questions:
1. "How long have you been trading?"
2. "What's your monthly turnover?"
3. "Do you currently have any business funding?"
4. "What would you use the funding for?"
5. "Do you take card payments?"

### Required Information & Bill Upload Process:
- **Trading History**: Minimum 6 months
- **Monthly Revenue**: Assessment varies by product type
- **Current Supplier Bills**: **Upload highest bills from last 6 months** for accurate LTV assessment
- **Bank Statements**: Last 3 months
- **ID & Address Proof**: Directors
- **Business Information**: Company house details

#### Critical: Upload Current Supplier Bills
**For accurate commission calculation, always request:**
- Upload bills from current funding provider (if any)
- Focus on **highest volume/cost months** within 6 months
- *Seasonal tip: In December, emphasize bills from June onwards*
- This ensures LTV calculation reflects true business funding needs

## Positioning & Sales Scripts

### Opening Approach:
*"I help businesses like yours access growth capital quickly and easily. Most business owners don't realize there are funding options that don't require personal guarantees or lengthy approval processes. Are you looking at any growth opportunities that could benefit from additional working capital?"*

### Merchant Cash Advance Positioning:
*"This isn't a traditional loan - it's a cash advance against your future card sales. So if you have a quiet day, you pay less back. If you have a busy day, you pay more. It flexes with your business, and there's no set monthly payment to worry about."*

### Benefits to Emphasize:
✅ **Quick Approval**: Decisions within 24-48 hours
✅ **Flexible Repayments**: Based on actual sales performance
✅ **No Personal Guarantees**: For most MCA products
✅ **Use for Anything**: Equipment, stock, expansion, cash flow
✅ **UK-Based Team**: Direct support throughout the process

## Commission Structure & LTV Methodology

### How Funding Commissions Are Calculated:
Using our £250 per £10,000 base rate, commissions are calculated through LTV analysis:

#### LTV Factors for Business Funding:
- **Funding Amount**: Base £250 per £10,000 structure  
- **Business Profile**: Industry, trading history, growth potential
- **Product Type**: MCA, loans, or asset-based lending
- **Repayment Terms**: Longer terms = higher LTV value
- **Cross-sell Potential**: Payment processing, insurance, equipment
- **Risk Assessment**: Security, credit profile, business stability

#### Commission Levels:
- **Level 1 (Direct)**: 60% of calculated LTV commission
- **Level 2 (Team)**: 20% ongoing from team member success
- **Level 3 (Network)**: 10% ongoing from extended network

### Building Monthly Income:
While direct funding referrals provide upfront commissions, focus on team building to create consistent monthly income through the 20% and 10% ongoing structure.

## Real Client Success Stories

### Case Study 1: Italian Restaurant
**Challenge**: Needed funding for kitchen refurbishment
**Solution**: Merchant Cash Advance tailored to their needs
**Outcome**: Kitchen upgraded, 40% increase in covers, cross-sold payment processing
**Result**: Upfront commission plus ongoing monthly income from payment processing

### Case Study 2: Dental Practice
**Challenge**: Equipment purchase for digital scanner
**Solution**: Asset-based lending with competitive terms
**Outcome**: Reduced treatment times, increased capacity, equipment financing package
**Result**: Substantial commission reflecting LTV of large equipment financing plus growth potential

### Case Study 3: Online Retailer
**Challenge**: Stock purchase for seasonal peak
**Solution**: Unsecured loan with flexible terms
**Outcome**: 200% sales increase during peak season, added payment processing
**Result**: Commission based on LTV methodology plus ongoing income from increased payment processing

## Objection Handling

**"Interest rates seem high"**
→ "You're right to consider the cost, but let's look at the return on investment. If this funding helps you increase revenue by even 20%, the ROI is significant. Plus, with our flexible products, you're only paying when you're earning."

**"We'll speak to our bank first"**
→ "Absolutely, you should explore all options. What I find is that traditional banks can take 6-12 weeks and often require extensive security. We can get you an approval in principle within 24 hours at no cost, so you can compare properly."

**"We don't want debt"**
→ "I understand that completely. Our merchant cash advance isn't actually debt - it's purchasing your future sales at a discount. You're in complete control of repayments through your sales volume."

## Your Action Plan

### Week 1-2: Learning & Setup
- Complete this module and quiz
- Review client qualification criteria
- Practice positioning scripts
- Identify 20 potential prospects

### Week 3-4: Prospecting & Qualification
- Contact 10 warm prospects
- Qualify 5 serious opportunities

### Monthly Target:
- **Conversations**: 40 qualified prospects
- **Applications**: 8 submitted
- **Approvals**: 3-4 (37.5% conversion rate)

Remember: Business funding solves real problems and helps businesses grow. You're not selling debt - you're providing growth capital that can transform a business.

## The Funding Process

4. **Funding Need**: What's the money for?
5. **Credit History**: Any major issues?

6. **Funding** (24-48 hours after acceptance)

### Documentation Required
**For MCA:**

**For Traditional Loans:**
- Financial statements (P&L, Balance Sheet)
- Tax returns (business and personal)
- Bank statements (6 months)
- Business plan (for larger amounts)

## Identifying Funding Opportunities

### Warning Signs of Cash Flow Issues
- Slow-paying customers
- Seasonal business fluctuations
- Equipment breakdowns
- Expansion opportunities
- Marketing campaign needs
- Inventory requirements
- Staff hiring needs

### Conversation Starters
"I noticed you're quite busy - are you looking at expanding?"
"How's business been? Any plans for growth this year?"
"I work with a lot of businesses like yours who need capital for expansion..."
"Have you ever looked into business funding for equipment or growth?"

### Qualifying Questions
1. "What would you do with an extra £25,000 in your business?"
2. "How much do you process in card payments monthly?"
3. "Have you applied for business funding before?"
4. "What's your biggest challenge in growing the business?"
5. "How quickly would you need access to funds?"

## Overcoming Common Objections

### "Interest rates are too high"
**Response**: "I understand cost is important. Let's look at the return on investment. If this £25,000 helps you generate an extra £5,000 per month in revenue, the cost becomes much more reasonable. Plus, you only pay when you're making money through card sales."

### "We don't need funding right now"
**Response**: "That's actually the best time to secure funding - when you don't desperately need it. Having access to capital when opportunities arise can be the difference between growing and staying stagnant. Would you like to know what you'd qualify for, just to have the option?"

### "Banks turned us down"
**Response**: "That's exactly why alternative funding exists. Banks have very strict criteria and slow processes. Our lenders specialize in working with businesses like yours and can often approve deals that banks won't touch. The application is simple and there's no obligation."

### "We're worried about daily payments"
**Response**: "I understand that concern. The beauty of merchant cash advance is that payments automatically adjust to your sales. Busy day = slightly higher payment. Slow day = lower payment. It's designed to work with your cash flow, not against it."

## Calculating Funding Potential

### MCA Quick Calculator
**Daily sales method:**
Average daily card sales × 30 = Monthly card sales
Monthly card sales × 10 = Potential funding amount

**Example:**
£800 daily card sales × 30 = £24,000 monthly
£24,000 × 10 = £240,000 potential funding

### Affordability Assessment
**Comfortable payment rate: 8-12% of daily sales**
**Maximum payment rate: 15-20% of daily sales**

**Example with £800 daily sales:**
- Comfortable: £64-£96 daily payment
- Maximum: £120-£160 daily payment

## Best Practices for Funding Sales

### Building Trust
- Be transparent about costs and terms
- Explain how the process works clearly
- Provide references from similar businesses
- Show examples of successful funding cases

### Professional Presentation
- Use our funding calculators and materials
- Present multiple options when available
- Show clear benefit analysis
- Provide detailed term sheets

### Follow-up Strategy
- Check in during application process
- Help gather required documents
- Address concerns promptly
- Celebrate successful funding

### Relationship Management
- Monitor business performance post-funding
- Identify additional funding needs
- Refer for other services
- Ask for referrals to other businesses

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Business Red Flags
- Declining sales trends
- Legal issues or disputes
- Poor credit with no explanation
- Unrealistic funding expectations
- Unwillingness to provide documentation

### Personal Red Flags
- Recent bankruptcy (under 2 years)
- Multiple recent credit inquiries
- Defaulted business loans
- Criminal financial fraud history

## Advanced Strategies
